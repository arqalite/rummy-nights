**Background and context**
Describe the context of the feature, the use-case, or what currently needs to be improved.
(e.g. I play with the same people all the time, so I'd appreciate having a template to quickly start a game with them.)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
(e.g. I want a quick-start button on the home screen that loads a template I defined and starts a new game directly)

**(For developers) Implementation details**
If you have Rust/Dioxus experience, share how you would implement this. 
Brainstorm logic and UX here.
