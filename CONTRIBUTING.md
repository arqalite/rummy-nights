# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project! Depending on what you'd like to help out with, there are a few rules and guidelines to follow.

Before getting started, make sure to read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - keeping this space as civil as possible is crucial for collaboration.

Here are a few ways you can help:
- [Report a bug/issue](./CONTRIBUTING.md#report-a-bugissue)

## Report a bug/issue
Found something wrong with the app?

- Check if someone already reported it by searching the [Issues](https://github.com/arqalite/rummy-nights/issues) page.
- If nothing comes up, create a new issue. 
  - Include as much information as you can, every little bit helps.
  - Try to follow the template as much as possible, but don't be afraid to add new things to the issue. 
  - If something is not applicable, write "N/A" or provide context as to why it's not applicable. Don't leave it blank please.
- If you have Rust/Dioxus experience but you're not able/willing to try and fix the issue, try to come up with a possible solution that we can try and implement. 
If you want to do more, let's [write some code](./CONTRIBUTING.md#Contributing-code)

## Contributing code
Help us make the app better!

First, let's determine what kind of contribution you want to make - patching a bug, adding a new feature, performance optimizations or just code quality/refactoring?

#### Bug patches
- If you want to fix a bug, make sure an [issue](https://github.com/arqalite/rummy-nights/issues) for it exists. If not, create one by following the template.
- Fork the repo, write your patch, and test thoroughly!
- [Create and submit your pull request](./CONTRIBUTING.md#Pull-requests).

#### Adding new features
- If an issue for it exists and is being tracked for a future release (has a milestone on it), start working on it directly. As with bug fixes, fork the repo, write code, and test thoroughly.
- If an issue doesn't exist for the feature you want to add - don't start writing code yet! 
  - Please first create an issue explaining the feature and what needs to be implemented for it to work. 
  - We'll discuss the feature together and determine if it should be added to the app or not, and gather feedback on it. 
  - Once the issue has a milestone added to it, you can start working on it. 
  - Keep the issue updated with information, technical details and thoughts you feel are relevant.
  - Once the feature is in good shape, [create and submit your pull request](./CONTRIBUTING.md#Pull-requests).

#### Pull requests
- Before submitting the pull request, squash your commits and include the issue number in the commit message. Squashing prevents git log clutter, and including the issue number helps for tracking changes as needed.
- Our commits follow a more relaxed version of [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). So far, we make use of the following commit types:
  - `fix`
